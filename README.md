# Magento-1.9-to-Unleashed-Price-Modifier

This is a template README from https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2
Thank you PurpleBooth!

This is a WPF program in order to take information from an Unleashed Inventory product .csv export and convert the data into a Magento 1.9 upload .csv.
It's currently VERY niche, for this particular use as I need it quite quickly. I hope to rewrite the program to be less specific once it's up and running.
