Thank you PurpleBooth!

This is a WPF program in order to take information from an Unleashed Inventory product .csv export and convert the data into a Magento 1.9 upload .csv.
It's currently VERY niche, for this particular use as I need it quite quickly. I hope to rewrite the program to be less specific once it's up and running.
